### Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `belly-button-challenge`. *Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository*.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, copy the files from in the `StarterCode` folder contained within the Module 14 Challenge zip file. i.e. `index.html`, `samples.json`, and the `static` folder.

    > **Note** You will not be required to access the samples.json file locally, but it is provided for reference.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.

5. Deploy the new repository to GitHub Pages.

### Files

Download the following files to help you get started:

### Instructions

Complete the following steps:

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json`.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

    * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

    * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

    * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

    * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

    * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

    * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

    * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

    * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

4. Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

   * Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.

   * Append an html tag with that text to the `#sample-metadata` panel.

5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard is shown as follows:

6. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file

### Hints

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.

### Submission

To submit your Challenge assignment, click Submit, and then provide the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

> **Note** You are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest two grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next module.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in Bootcamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or your Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an additional review, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

> **Important:** **It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo**. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.
